# spotify-and-lyrics-dataset-generator

A set of helper scripts to combine song attributes provided by Spotify to lyrics sourcable on LyricGenius.

The Spotify API provides a series of attributes for song-artist search pairings:
- popularity
- danceability
- energy
- etc...

However, they do not actually provide lyrics alongside the response. These scripts help scrape and join lyrics to the Spotify entries.
